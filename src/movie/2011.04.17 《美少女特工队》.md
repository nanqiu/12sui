# 美少女特工队

这部片子挺好看的, 不过里边战争场面有点多了, 看的有点累. 感觉第一幕梦境的打斗有点中国功夫的影子. 整个电影场面设计的非常精彩, 值得一看!

故事结尾的总结很给力, 也最能震撼人心, 其实整个故事讲的就是这些:

> And finally, this question. The mystery of whose story it will be. Of who draws the curtain. Who is it that chooses our steps in the dance? Who drives us mad, lashes us with whips and crowns us with victory when we survive the impossible? Who is it that tells all these things?

> Who honors those we love for the very life we live? Who sends monsters to kill us and at the same time sings that we’ll never die? Who teaches us what’s real and how to laugh at lies? Who decides why we live and what we’ll die to defend? Who chains us and who holds the key that can set us free? It’s you. You have all the weapons you need. Now fight!
